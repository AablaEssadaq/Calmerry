# Calmerry - Mental Health Website (Multi-Page)

A multi-page **responsive** **website** for Calmerry, a mental health support platform. The design focuses on creating a **calm**, **professional**, and **inviting experience** for users seeking therapy services online., built using:

- **Next.js** for fast and efficient rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek and responsive styling

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

This project was inspired by a blog page design by **Rita Hladilina**.  
Original design: [Behance Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/183676969/Mental-Health-Website-Calmerry)

I initially coded the blog page as it appears in the original design. Later, I decided to design my own versions of the About Us, Pricing, and Contacts pages in Figma—while keeping the same visual identity and color palette to maintain consistency.
